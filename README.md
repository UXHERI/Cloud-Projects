# ​​ Cloud Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Cloud Projects** hub — where cloud-native ideas meet real-world execution. This repo captures hands-on deployments, automation, and infrastructure work that demonstrate true cloud engineering at its finest.

Whether you're a fellow cloud enthusiast, recruiter, or curious learner — pull up a chair. You'll find practical implementations of AWS services, infrastructure automation, and scalable architectures ready to explore and deploy.

## ​ What’s Inside

- 🌤️ Projects that explore **AWS cloud services** — from compute and storage to networking and IAM.
- 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform** — provision, manage, and evolve resources programmatically.
- 🔄 Automation patterns for deploying, scaling, and securing cloud components.
- ⚙️ Real-world setups selected and documented for clarity and learning.
- 🗂 Clean organization and reusable Terraform modules for portability and rapid experimentation.

Every setup is designed to be modular, repeatable, and practical — making this repo both a playground and a portfolio.
